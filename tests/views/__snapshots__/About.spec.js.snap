        <p>
           Take a picture from your phone, and Realness creates a vector graphic composed into five animatable layers; from a bright background to a dark foreground. 
        </p>
        <p>
           This is a serviece for people who want to trust each other and commited to the dicipline and work to make that happen. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Your Poster is a natural fit for the web. Posters are optimized to be expressive, small, and to run fast. You can extract a color palette, animate a filter or gradient. The individual parts of a Poster are easy to query and feel natural to access and manipulate.

           Realness is a way and a support system to help you build web applications. 
        </p>
        <p>
           It's natural to build web applications with HTML, especially for 
          <i>
            Edge first
          </i>
          . Orienting to this has helped Realness take advantage of what's possible on the web today. How you build your app can create opportunities over the monetized client-server model we are used to today. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Edge first is native, fast, more secure, and gives you choices around data storage that don't exist traditionally. With an Edge-first approach, you can make a quick and seamless transition from a User Experience demo to product development. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Edge on the web opens the DOM up as a typing system and object model. There are natural constraints on HTML that support accessible applications. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Developers can use Realness to free themselves from SQL and the tyranny of a full-stack mindset. Development roles can be less hierarchical. Products can be fun to build, naturally more in line with our customers' expectations. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Build applications faster with less overhead that keeps stakeholders involved. All this using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Can a single developer provide a service all can use? Scott Fryxell is the developer behind Realness, and that's what I'm trying to find out.
