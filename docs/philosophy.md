Realness is a social network that's more tool than popularity contest. It uses your phone number so you get built-in messaging and group text.  All of your information stays on your device. You create Statements and Posters to keep the people close to you informed. Realness tries to be as small as possible so that you can trust the affection it makes you feel.

Realness is run by Moderators. Everyone can become a moderator.  Becoming a moderator means taking responsibility for and becoming more aware of how the internet is built and run. We believe this is critical knowledge that supports the fundamental needs of citizens in a democracy. Freedom, with clear areas of personal responsibility.

## Perspective

Realness has strongly held opinions about two questions

#### How is the contact with the people we care about supposed to go?
#### What about the internet we are on the hook to understand?

## What you can do with Realness

- You sign up with your phone number
- You can post statements that become trains of thought as you add to them
- You create vector posters from your photographs or camera
- You can look for people you may know on Realness
- You can add those people  
- You can view a feed of what those people want to say
- You can contact a Moderator you probably know in real life to get your questions answered

There are no likes. There are no friend counts. There are no comments.

Every positive decision made has been in support of natural, supportive human relationships online.

The choice to use Vector graphics (SVG if your nasty) to downplay visible importance to stress creativity and make more room for a sense of genuine belonging.

You text when your friends post something that moves you.

Realness tries to stay as background as a phone number; We trust in the love between family, friends, and community to be the magnet that binds us together.

## Realness is your tool. Moderators are your friends.
