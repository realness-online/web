# Realness – Philosophy

![Realness](/public/icons.svg)

- How is the contact with the people we care about supposed to go?
- What about the internet are we on the hook to understand?

Realness tries to be as small as possible so that you can trust the affection it generates. The server knows your phone number and the content you create. Thoughts, Posters, Events, Avatars. Relations sync across your devices. Images that you upload to create Posters and Avatars, are converted on device and then discarded.

We get Messaging and group chat for free since we authorize with phone numbers. Your phone number is the shared with a third party for authorization.

Realness believes moderators should be at the center of social networking. Moderators keep it human. Everyone can become a moderator. Moderating an instance of realness will improve internet literacy. We believe realness is a natural form of social networking that supports the fundamental needs of citizens in a democracy. The hope is that having an ecosystem of moderators relieves some of the pressure to pick a side. Within realness we are free to accept each other as different and yet share an ethos of community responsibility.

There are no likes. There are no friend counts. There are no comments. And the application is not playing engagement games with your mind.

You text when your friends post something that moves you.

Realness tries to stay as background as a phone number. We trust that the love between family, friends, and community is enough to bind us together.

###### Realness is your tool. Moderators are your friends.
