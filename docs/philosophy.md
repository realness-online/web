How is the contact with the people we care about supposed to go?  What about the internet are we on the hook to understand?

It uses your phone number so you get built in messaging and group text.  Your information stays on your device. Realness tries to be as small as possible so that you can trust the affection it makes you feel.

Realness is run by Moderators. Just like keeping the data out on the phone. We believe moderators are a more natural focus for the app. Everyone can become a moderator. Becoming a moderator means taking responsibility for how the internet is built and run. We believe realness is a natural form of social networking that supports the fundamental needs of citizens in a democracy. We are all Freedom, with clear areas of personal responsibility.

## What you can do with Realness

- You sign up with your phone number
- You can post statements that become trains of thought as you add to them
- You turn pictures into vector graphics that you use as posters and avatars
- You can look for people you may know on Realness
- You can add those people  
- You can view a feed of what those people want to say
- You can contact a Moderator you probably know in real life to get your questions answered

There are no likes. There are no friend counts. There are no comments. And the application is not playing engagement games with your mind.

You text when your friends post something that moves you.

Realness tries to stay as background as a phone number. We trust that the love between family, friends, and community is enough to bind us together.

## Realness is your tool. Moderators are your friends.
